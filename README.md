# TicTacToe
This is a little Tic Tac Toe game i made with Python.
Its one of my first projects i made, and it was quite hard.
The board is split into 9 fields. From left to the right.
This means its built like this√ñ

1 I 2 I 3
4 I 5 I 6
7 I 8 I 9

one of these numbers you would put into your console and it is going to place an X or an O, depending on who is the active player.
